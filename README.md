## üî• Backend Wizard | Data Alchemist | Tech Sorcerer üîÆ

### **‚ÄúI turn algorithms into scalable magic, databases into performance beasts, and code into optimized, high-impact solutions."**  
Welcome to my realm, where backend sorcery meets data alchemy, and where only the most performant, optimized, and scalable systems survive. I engineer architectures that scale like a rocket and optimize systems to the core with low-level optimizations that will make your CPU high-five you. From mastering Python to conjuring SQL queries that execute faster than you can blink, I'm the architect of your next big tech breakthrough.

## **About Me**

Currently unraveling the complexities of Computer Science at **Minerva University**, I‚Äôm on a journey to master **Data Structures, Algorithms**, and **Machine Learning** like a mad scientist who‚Äôs obsessed with efficiency. What drives me? Creating systems that don't just work‚Äîthey break performance barriers.

### **Currently**:
- Perfecting web development mastery and technical interview strategies with **CodePath**.
- Getting deep into **Machine Learning** pipelines and automating data wrangling like a wizard with **Pandas**.
- Building ultra-scalable backends using **Flask**, **Node.js**, and **SQLAlchemy** to create systems that power millions of transactions and requests without a hiccup.

---

## ‚ö° **Skills & Technologies**  

- **Languages**: Python, SQL, JavaScript (Eager to conquer Rust, C++, and Go soon)
- **Frameworks**: Flask (built RESTful APIs that process 10k+ requests per minute), Node.js (optimized for async-heavy applications), SQLAlchemy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, MySQL (Optimized multi-table joins, indexing strategies, and query refactoring for 10x speedups)
- **Data Tools**: Pandas (handling large datasets like a pro), NumPy, Seaborn, GeoJSON, Matplotlib
- **DevOps & Tools**: Git, CI/CD pipelines (Infrastructure as code to keep systems 100% automated)
- **Cloud Platforms**: AWS (EC2, RDS, S3), Render (deployment), Heroku, Vercel, and Firebase.
